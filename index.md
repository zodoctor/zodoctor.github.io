## About Me
I am a PhD student in the Physics Department at University of Chicago and in the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics (KICP). 

## Research
My research focuses on the analysis of signals from high-energy astrophysical phenomena.
* Gravitational waves (GWs) with LIGO
* Optical follow-up to GWs with DES
Overall, I study some of the most extreme events and the implications of those extreme events on e.g. the expansion of the universe, the physics of nuclear matter, and the origin of the elements.

## What Are Gravitational Waves?
Gravitational waves (GWs) are "ripples in spacetime" first theoretically discovered by Einstein a century ago and subsequently detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015.  These waves are sourced by the movements of massive bodies, such as collisions of black holes and neutron stars. GWs propagate essentially unperturbed through the universe while ever-so-slightly stretching and squeezing spacetime as they pass.  This stretching and squeezing is what interferometers like the LIGO instruments and the European counterpart Virgo are able to detect.  

## What Can We Learn From Gravitational Waves?
Here's a (wildly incomplete) list of science questions we can investigate through gravitational waves:
* How big are the black holes and neutron stars in the universe? Do they tend to be spinning fast or not?
* What is the structure of neutron stars?
* What is the current expansion rate of the universe?
* What is the origin of heavy elements such as gold and platinum?

## Combining Gravitational Waves With Light
Another aspect of my research is searching for flashes of light associated with mergers of black holes and/or neutron stars.  So far, no one has definitively seen any light emitted from two black holes merging, but we're still searching!  In August of 2017, we saw our first ever neutron star merger in GWs as well as across the electromagnetic spectrum.  The team I work with was one of the first to capture images of hot material ejected from the collision of the two neutron stars, and the data from those images has been used to understand the formation of heavy elements, the expansion rate of the universe, and the structure of neutron stars.  Using both GW and electromagnetic data together enables us to get even better constraints on what is happening in these extreme astrophysical events.
